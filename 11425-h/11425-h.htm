    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>The announcement of Mr. Justice BRAY that bigamy is rampant
    at the present time has been drawn to the notice of the
    FOOD-CONTROLLER, who wishes it to be clearly understood that
    under no circumstances will the head of a family be allowed a
    sugar ration for more than one wife.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"I have in my possession," writes a correspondent of <i>The
    Evening News</i>, "a loaf of bread made by my husband's mother
    in 1821." This should dispose of the popular belief that nobody
    anticipated the War except Mr. BLATCHFORD.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Lug-worms are being sold at Deal for five shillings a score.
    They are stated to form an agreeable substitute for
    macaroni.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"In China," says <i>The Daily Express</i>, "a chicken can
    still be purchased for sixpence." Intending purchasers should
    note, however, that at present the return fare to Shanghai
    brings the total cost a trifle in excess of the present London
    prices.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A recent applicant to the Warwickshire Appeal Tribunal
    claimed that he had captured the German shell-less egg trade.
    He denied that the enemy had purposely allowed it to
    escape.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A tramp charged at Kingston with begging was wearing three
    overcoats, two coats, two pair of trousers and an enormous pair
    of boots. It seems strange that this man should not have
    realised that he was in a position to earn a handsome salary as
    a music-hall comedian.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Owing to a cow straying on the line at Acton Bridge last
    week a goods train was derailed. It seems that the unfortunate
    animal was not aware that cow-catchers had been abolished.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is reported that the two thousand taxi-drivers still on
    strike have decided to offer their services to Sir AUCKLAND
    GEDDES for munition work. Suitable employment will be found for
    them in a high-expletive factory.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In New York a club has been started exclusively for golfers.
    The others insisted on it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A notice exhibited in the window of a Bermondsey
    public-house bears the words, "There is nothing like Government
    Ale." Agreed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Shrimps," says a Southern Command Order, "should not be
    purchased where a long train journey is involved." For
    soldiers, however, who require this kind of diet little
    excursions to the seaside can always be arranged for with the
    C.O.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At Aberavon the other day the son of an interned German was
    bitten by a dog which he had kicked by accident. The dog of
    course did not know it was an accident.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We are the first to record the fact that a dear old lady,
    the other morning, went up to the Tank in Trafalgar Square and
    offered it a bun.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We should like to deny the rumour that when he heard of Lord
    ROTHERMERE's appointment to the Air Ministry Lord NORTHCLIFFE
    muttered, "Alas! my poor brother."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>More bread is being eaten than ever, says the FOOD
    CONTROLLER. It appears that the stuff is now eaten by itself,
    instead of being spread thinly on butter, as in pre-war
    days.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The largest telescope in the World has just been erected at
    the Mount Wilson Observatory in California. Enthusiasts predict
    that the end of the War will be clearly visible through it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Owing to scarcity of petrol several fire-brigades have had
    again to resort to horses. In consequence people who have fires
    are requested to place their orders at once, as they can only
    be dealt with in strict rotation.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The prisoner who escaped from the Manchester Assize Court,
    after being sentenced to three years' imprisonment, has
    explained that he was just pretending to be a German
    prisoner.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An awkward situation has arisen through Mr. GEORGE BERNARD
    SHAW and Mr. GEORGE MOORE having solved the Irish problem in
    the same week, as one or the other of them is certain to claim
    the credit of having his solution rejected.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Blasting" for tin is being carried on in an experimental
    station in Cornwall. Similar operations are said to be used in
    searching for sugar.</p>

        condition."&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Before starting to save for the above purpose, we should
    like to know more about this scion of the "foreign (British)

        method of arganising the offensive in

    <h2>LEAVES FROM A LONDON NOTE-BOOK.</h2>

    <h3>BY OUR MAN ABOUT TOWN.</h3>

    <h4>(With acknowledgments to some of our Metropolitan penny
    evening papers.)</h4>

    <p><b>Sugar Cards.</b></p>

    <p>A highly-placed official tells me that the discovery that a
    number of people move about from place to place, that servants
    sometimes leave their situations, and that households are
    consequently liable to variation in their personnel, is due to
    a very smart member of the Sugar Commission, who will be
    suitably decorated. This discovery, on the very eve of
    compulsory rationing in other commodities, will mean an immense
    saving of national funds. Instead of billions, only a few
    millions of cards will need to be destroyed&mdash;a very useful
    economy.</p>

    <p><b>A Great Mayfair Effort.</b></p>

    <p>The Mayfair Tableaux Association will shortly hold a Fancy
    Dress Exhibition of Really Beautiful War-workers. The subjects
    represented will range from CLEOPATRA to BOTTICELLI'S
    "Primavera," and from SALOME to the Sistine Madonna.
    Preliminary photographs are about to appear in the Society
    Press. The particular object of this great sacrifice in the
    cause of charity has not yet been determined upon, but will be
    announced in due course.</p>

    <p><b>The Submarine Menace.</b></p>

    <p>No significance should be attached to recent statistics of
    torpedoed ships in view of public announcements to the effect
    that the submarine menace has been practically scotched.</p>

    <p><b>International Bolo.</b></p>

    <p>The British Parliamentary Branch of the International Bolo
    Club indignantly deny that they have received a single pony, or
    any less sum, from German sympathisers in support of Pacifist
    propaganda. They generously recognise that Germany's economical
    straits are even greater than ours, and they would not
    willingly, even for the sake of a common cause, put a strain
    upon the resources of their German friends.</p>

    <p><b>Mahenge.</b></p>

    <p>The other day I consulted an old friend on the Imperial
    Staff as to the pronunciation of Mahenge, the scene of our
    latest victory in East Africa. From the evasive character of
    his reply I gathered that my inquiry was of the nature of an
    indiscretion.</p>

    <p><b>The Cabinet and the "Vicious Circle."</b></p>

    <p>Several members of the Cabinet&mdash;the one that doesn't
    meet&mdash;have informed me of their conviction that, in the
    event of the War lasting on into 1920, there is every prospect
    of establishing an elementary co-ordination between the various
    Government departments. Meanwhile they ask me to correct a
    confusion in the public mind by which the "Vicious Circle" is
    regarded as a synonym for themselves.</p>

    <p><b>Manhood and Moral.</b></p>

    <p>Every day brings me a sheaf of correspondence in which I am
    asked to give my opinion as to our prospects of victory in the
    near future. I have one formula for reply. I refer my
    correspondents to a recurrent paragraph in <i>The Times</i>
    under the heading "News in Brief." It runs as follows: "At the
    close of play yesterday in the billiard match of 16,000 points
    up, between Inman and Stevenson, at the Grand Hall, Leicester
    Square, the scores were," etc., etc. After all, the deciding
    features in the Great World-Struggle will be manhood and
    <i>moral</i>.</p>

    <p><b>Trotsky's Peace Overtures.</b></p>

    <p>From private sources, which corroborate the information
    given to the public, I hear that the Spanish
    Charg&eacute;-d'Affaires at Petrograd is the only member of the
    Diplomatic Corps in that capital who has taken cognisance of
    TROTSKY'S overtures (which, of course, must be distinguished
    from TSCHAIKOWSKY'S). I very much doubt if KING ALFONSO had a
    hand in this, though he has more than once intimated to me his
    desire for peace.</p>

    <p><b>Lansdowne and Lenin.</b></p>

    <p>What with the aircraft strike at Coventry and the activities
    of Lord LANSDOWNE, LENIN and others, this has been a great week
    for Pacifists and Pro-Bosches. In Germany, where the Press has
    eagerly followed <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> in giving
    prominence to Lord LANSDOWNE'S views, it is felt that our
    EX-FOREIGN SECRETARY ought to receive a step in the peerage,
    with the title Duke of Lansdowne and Handsup.</p>

    <p><b>The Premier Abroad.</b></p>

    <p>In conversation with Mr. LLOYD GEORGE on the occasion of one
    of his flying visits to England, I learned how much he
    regretted that pressure of time prevented him while in Italy
    from running over to Venice and ascending the restored
    Campanile. While in residence in Paris, however, he had had the
    pleasure of renewing his acquaintance with the Eiffel
    Tower.</p>

    <p><b>Browning and Swinburne.</b></p>

    <p>During the dark hour of trial through which Italy has been
    passing, my thoughts have often strayed to Asolo in the
    Trevisan, the scene of <i>Pippa Passes</i>, by the late ROBERT
    BROWNING (whom I knew well). "Italy, what of the night?" wrote
    my old friend SWINBURNE. "Morning's at seven!" replies
    <i>Pippa</i>. Those brave words have heartened me a good
    deal.</p>

    <h2>MILLIE AND THE "KAYSER."</h2>

    <p>Millie is a "daily help." Who it is that she
    helps&mdash;whether herself or her employer&mdash;I am not in a
    position to say, for I am only temporarily a lodger in the
    house where Millie helps, and she doesn't help me much. But
    to-day I have made her hear and understand one whole sentence.
    It is the first time during the six days that we have known
    each other that I have conveyed anything to her except by
    graphic gesticulation and grimace.</p>

    <p>I accepted the fact at the outset that my soft and seductive
    tones could never penetrate Millie's stone-deafness. Only the
    loudest and angriest remarks are audible to Millie, so I
    preserve an attitude of silent facial amiability in all my
    relations with her.</p>

    <p>BALAAM could not have looked more surprised than did Millie
    this evening when, in the act of clearing away my latest meal,
    she heard me say, "Leave the matches."</p>

    <p>She stopped dead and looked at me over the tray of dirty
    crockery. Her expression was not unfriendly.</p>

    <p>"But I got t' look after myself," she explained; "I'd be all
    done up if I hadn't they matches in the morning to light the
    fire and all. You wouldn't get no bath-water."</p>

    <p>"I want to smoke," I said obstinately.</p>

    <p>She kept her hand over the box of matches. She had not
    heard. I made intelligent signs illustrative of the lighting of
    a cigarette. Millie told me, in pure Cornish:</p>

    <p>"You can only get a box at a time now, and half-a-pound o'
    sugar I gets when I shows my card, and they do say we won't get
    that&mdash;only quarter soon. I'd like to get at that KAYSER!
    I'd smash him up, I would!" She said this in the kindest, most
    benign way, with a smile as nearly caressing as a smile without
    front teeth can be. "He'd come short off if I got to him! And
    he deserves it, I'm sure," she concluded, as she
    departed&mdash;with the matches....</p>

    <p>A long walk over the Cornish cliffs in the gusty North wind
    from the Atlantic had made me drowsy, and as I sat before the
    fire my thoughts wandered from Russian politics and the Italian
    situation to Millie&mdash;and the "KAYSER": Millie, who was
    short of stature and round-backed, who showed her fifty-odd
    years unflinchingly to the world; Millie with her felt slippers
    and her overall and coarse hands; Millie, the possessor of a
    sugar-card&mdash;and the mighty War Lord, stern and implacable,
    trying to subdue the world to his will. And Millie only wished
    she could get near him to smash him up&mdash;"the KAYSER would
    come short off."...</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The lamp-lit cottage room faded; the sound of November winds
    and swirling leaves outside died away. For a moment I peered
    through a greyish-blue moving mist&mdash;it might have been
    cigarette smoke; gradually I distinguished forms and colours
    beyond; then the fog lifted and I looked upon an
    electrically-lighted room, with the aspect of an office <i>de
    luxe</i>. There were telephones and file cases, typewriters and
    all the appurtenances of business operations; the furniture was
    massive and handsome, and carpets and hangings had every
    appearance of magnificence and costliness.</p>

    <p>I knew without thought that this was the private room of
    WILHELM of Prussia. He himself, standing with his back to the
    roaring log fire in the deep grate, was too like the cartoons
    in the English papers to be mistaken. The iron-grey hair and
    upturned moustache, the cold eyes and sardonic mouth were all
    there "as per invoice." He was even wearing an aggressively
    Prussian uniform, and kept his spiked helmet on his head and
    his sword hanging at his side.</p>

    <p>The CROWN PRINCE was in evidence, disguised as a Death's
    Head Hussar, and HINDENBURG was easily recognisable as he
    bristled with the nails which the admiring populace had
    hammered into him; the rest of the company were unknown to me.
    They were all engaged in a heated discussion when suddenly
    there came a knock at the door, a knock which, to me, was
    curiously familiar.</p>

    <p>During the silence that ensued Millie walked into the room.
    She was still wearing her overall and felt slippers, and she
    had not waited to put on a hat or even to straighten her hair.
    She came forward unhesitatingly, with her short, shuffling
    steps and, disregarding the furious demand of a Bavarian
    General as to who she was and how she dared to enter there, she
    addressed herself to the KAISER himself. She spoke in her
    normal tones, but to me there seemed something sinister about
    them at this moment, and I noticed that in her right hand she
    carried a coal-hammer.</p>

    <p>Now above all things Millie hated breaking coal and filling
    scuttles, and I knew that she would not be carrying a
    coal-hammer without a very special reason. Her words revealed
    it.</p>

    <p>"You, KAYSER, I've been wanting to get near you and smash
    you up, I have. You've gone a bit too far, you have ... No
    sugar without a card, and then only half-a-pound, and they do
    say it'll only be a quarter soon. And
    <i>matches!</i>&mdash;only one box at a time, and <i>they</i>
    don't strike, and how's a body to light a fire at all?"</p>

    <p>With this she lifted her coal-hammer and brought it down
    with all her force on the KAISER'S head. Involuntarily I
    flinched; it was a terrible blow.</p>

    <p>Several Generals, their iron crosses jingling, rushed
    forward and seized Millie, uttering guttural sounds of horror
    and indignation. But the KAISER stood unmoved&mdash;yes,
    unmoved. Millie gaped at him. He ordered his satellites to
    release her and, as they reluctantly did so, Millie nodded her
    head at them.</p>

    <p>"You leave me where I'm to! He can take up his own part,"
    she told them.</p>

    <p>The KAISER addressed her sternly.</p>

    <p>"Presumptuous woman," he said, "it is not written that you
    shall be the cause of my death. There is something much higher
    in store for me. You deserve worse than death at my hands; but
    since you are from England I will squeeze from you all the
    information I require and bend you to my uses."</p>

    <p>All this was obviously wasted on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page379"
       id="page379"></a>[pg 379]</span> Millie, who heard nothing.
       Having waited politely until his lips stopped moving in
       speech, she again cracked him on the head with the
       coal-hammer.</p>

    <p>The KAISER ignored this uncivil retort and spoke again.</p>

    <p>"You shall go back to your matchless country and tell them
    there that we have plenty of matches in Germany; that we have
    kept on good terms with Stockholm, and our matches are made in
    Sweden. We have all we need to kindle every fire in hell. Now
    are you convinced that you are beaten?"</p>

    <p>He was interrupted by another blow from the coal-hammer,
    which made him bite his tongue, for Millie was becoming
    exasperated and put all her strength into the stroke. The
    KAISER stepped back.</p>

    <p>"Poor fool! You are wasting your strength, even as HAIG
    wastes <i>his</i> in blow after blow on the Western front."</p>

    <p>But even as he uttered the lying boast he tottered and fell
    back unconscious into the arms of LITTLE WILLIE.</p>

    <p>The Generals and Statesmen gathered round their stricken
    master, gabbling purest Prussian.</p>

    <p>Millie appeared satisfied at last, although the CROWN PRINCE
    had scarcely glanced at her, for she was not his type. She took
    advantage of the commotion to procure two boxes of matches
    which had been thrown carelessly on the table. These she
    bestowed mysteriously beneath her overall.</p>

    <p>"He deserved it too!" she muttered contentedly as she
    hobbled to the door; "and I don't believe so much about all his
    matches either. You can only get two boxes at a time even
    here." With this reflection she unostentatiously departed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Again that familiar knock....</p>

    <p>I was back in my little sitting-room in Cornwall and Millie
    entered with my candle, which she put down on the table rather
    noisily. I gave her the usual grin and nod of acknowledgment,
    and she wished me good-night and went.</p>

    <p>In the tray of the candlestick there was a box of matches. I
    picked it up and turned it over curiously. Could my dream have
    been true? Or was it only a coincidence that in blatant red
    letters on that match-box were the words:&mdash;</p>

    <h2>THEATRICAL CORRESPONDENCE</h2>

    <h3>SUPPLYING ONE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, "WHY DOES A DRAMATIST
    GROW OLD SOONER THAN ANYONE ELSE?"</h3>

    <p><i>From G. Sheridan Smith, author, to Sir James Benfield,
    actor-manager.</i></p>

    <p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Herewith I am forwarding a copy of an
    original three-act comedy, entitled, <i>Men and Munitions</i>.
    As the interest is largely topical I should he much obliged if
    you could let me have your verdict upon it with as little delay
    as possible.</p>

    <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

    <p>G. SHERIDAN SMITH.</p>

    <p><i>From the Same to his friend, Buskin Browne,
    actor.</i></p>

    <p>Dear B.B.,&mdash;By this post I am sending my new comedy,
    <i>Men and Munitions</i>, to your manager, whom I believe it
    should suit. If an occasion served for you to put in a word
    about it without too much trouble, I should be eternally
    grateful.</p>

    <p>Yours ever, G.S.S.</p>

    <p><i>From Buskin Browne, in answer.</i></p>

    <p>My Dear Man,&mdash;With all the pleasure in life. I fancy
    we're changing our bill shortly, and, as farce is all the rage
    just now, I'll boom your <i>Munition Mad</i> directly I get a
    chance. Best of luck.</p>

    <p>Yours, BEE-BEE.</p>

    <p><i>From G. Sheridan Smith, in reply. A telegram.</i></p>

    <p>Thousand thanks play called men and munitions comedy not
    farce.</p>

    <p><i>From the Same to the Same, six weeks later.</i></p>

    <p>Dear B.B.,&mdash;I hate to trouble you, but as I've heard
    nothing yet from the management about my comedy I am writing to
    ask if you can give me any idea of Sir J.B.'s intentions
    regarding it. Did he say anything that you dare repeat?</p>

    <p>Yours, G.S.S.</p>

    <p><i>From Buskin Browne, in answer, a fortnight later.</i></p>

    <p>Dear old Boy,&mdash;No chance as yet, as the chief has been
    away ill. But he comes back on Saturday, when I will mention
    the farce to him without fail.</p>

    <p>Yours "while this machine is to him," BEE-BEE.</p>

    <p><i>From G. Sheridan Smith, to Sir James Benfield, a month
    later.</i></p>

    <p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I was profoundly grieved to learn from a
    mutual friend that you had been so long on the sick list. Now,
    however, that you are at work again, and (I trust) fully
    restored to health, may I hope for a verdict upon my comedy,
    <i>Men and Munitions</i>, at your earliest convenience?</p>

    <p>With warmest congratulations,</p>

    <p>I am, Faithfully yours,</p>

            <p>O butcher, butcher of the bulbous eye,</p>

            <p>That in hoarse accents bidst me "buy, buy, buy!"</p>

            <p>Waving large hands suffused with brutish gore,</p>

            <p>Have I not found thee evil to the core?</p>

            <p>The greedy grocer grinds the face of me,</p>

            <p>The baker trades on my necessity,</p>

            <p>And from the milkman have I no surcease,</p>

            <p>But thou art Plunder's perfect masterpiece.</p>

            <p>These others are not always lost to shame;</p>

            <p>My grocer, now&mdash;last week he let me claim</p>

            <p>A pound of syrup&mdash;'twas a kindly deed</p>

            <p>To help a fellow-townsman in his need,</p>

            <p>Though harsh the price, and I was feign to crawl</p>

            <p>About his feet ere I might buy at all.</p>

            <p>But thou&mdash;although a myriad flocks may crop</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, November 26th</i>.&mdash;Rather a jolly day in
    the House of Commons. It was pleasant to hear Lord WOLMER,
    ingenuous youth, explaining, on behalf of the War Trade
    Department, that there was no danger of an unusually large
    consignment of rubber bathing-caps finding their way from
    Switzerland to the heads of German Fra&uuml;leins. To Colonel
    YATE belongs the credit of pointing out that people do not
    bathe in Switzerland in the winter.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:33%;">
        <a href="images/384-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/384-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>"Can't we go and have a steak
             somewhere?"<br />
        Mr. WILL THORNE.
    </div>

    <p>Where Russia is concerned Mr. BALFOUR declines to be
    included among the prophets; all he knows is that that unhappy
    country has not yet evolved a Government with which he can
    negotiate. He was more explicit regarding the German tale of a
    Privy Council in 1913, presided over by the KING, at which Mr.
    ASQUITH and Lord KITCHENER conspired with Sir EDWARD GREY and
    Lord MORLEY (whose "Reminiscences" are strangely silent on the
    subject) to declare war upon Germany. Who after this shall dare
    to say that the Germans have no imagination?</p>

    <p>Mr. WILL THORNE considers that compulsory rationing ought to
    be postponed until the menus at the hotels and clubs are cut
    down to two courses. Somebody ought to invite Mr. THORNE, who
    from his appearance I should judge to have a healthy appetite,
    to partake of one of these (alleged) Gargantuan feasts and see
    what he thinks of it. His comment would probably be, "Can't we
    go and have a steak somewhere?"</p>

    <p>When is a leaflet not a leaflet? "When it is an election
    address," says Sir GEORGE CAVE. At the same time he warned Mr.
    KING that if he thought to get round the new regulations by
    embodying his peculiar views in the form of electioneering
    literature he might still collide with "Dora." The warning was
    surely superfluous. The last thing any Pacifist M.P. wishes to
    do is to submit himself to the judgment of his
    constituents.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, November 27th</i>.&mdash;Mr. MACPHERSON'S
    statement that officers with the Expeditionary Force are
    supplied with whisky at prices varying from <i>3s. 6d</i>. to
    <i>6s</i>. a bottle may have horrified the teetotalers, but has
    intensified the patriotic desire of some of our Volunteers to
    share the hardships of these gallant fellows in the
    trenches.</p>

    <p>There was another long-drawn-out duel between Mr. HOUSTON
    and Sir LEO CHIOZZA MONEY on the subject of shipping freights.
    The House always enjoys these encounters, although the
    opponents, like the toy "wrestlers" of our youth, never get
    much "forrader." The Member for West Toxteth has probably
    forgotten more about the shipping trade than his opponent ever
    knew. But for all that Sir LEO keeps his end up, though his
    assertion that the consumer would not benefit if the Government
    charged "Blue-book rates" for ordinary cargo does not convince
    everybody. But then everybody does not understand
    Blue-books.</p>

        MR. HOUSTON. SIR LEO CHIOZZA MONEY.
    </div>

    <p><i>Wednesday, November 28th</i>.&mdash;The Peers were
    surprised to hear from Lord COURTNEY that he was not of the
    creed of the conscientious objector. They had been under the
    impression that his public career had been one long orgie of
    conscientious objection to everything that did not emanate from
    his own capacious brain. Even his hat and his waistcoat
    proclaim his defiance of conventional opinion.</p>

    <p>For weeks past the House of Commons has been invited to
    believe that German "pill-boxes" were composed of British
    cement; and the case seemed clear when a British officer wrote
    from Flanders the other day that he had discovered in the
    German lines a label plainly marked "Artificial Portland."
    Members were relieved to learn that the label came from a
    Belgian factory taken over by the Germans. "If those pill-boxes
    had really been made of our cement," said a Medway
    representative, "we should be hammering at them still."</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, November 29th</i>.&mdash;Question-time would be
    much more amusing if Ministers and Members were more
    accomplished in the art of repartee. A few are quick enough.
    When Mr. LEES SMITH complained that one of his statements had
    been described by the FOREIGN SECRETARY as a mare's nest Lord
    ROBERT CECIL swiftly replied that he did not remember the
    incident, but had no doubt that if his right hon. friend used
    the term it was justified.</p>

    <p>Under the Redistribution scheme as arranged by the Boundary
    Commissioners the name West Birmingham would have disappeared
    from the roll of constituencies. In graceful tribute to the
    memory of JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN the House unanimously agreed to
    its reinstatement. It also changed the name of the Woodstock
    division to the Banbury division; but the idea that this was
    done as a compliment to the junior Member for the City of
    London is, I am told, erroneous.</p>

    <p>Although he had been rendered absolutely dumb by shell-shock
    the soldier was able to earn a little extra money by doing odd
    jobs. But nothing could get his speech back. It was a very
    stubborn and perplexing case. For eighteen months he had not
    succeeded in uttering a word, though understanding everything
    that was said to him. All the usual devices had failed; every
    kind of sudden surprise to startle him into articulation had
    been attempted; electricity had been passed through the muscles
    of the tongue and larynx; doctors had discussed him with a
    volubility only equalled by his own silence. But he remained
    dumb. It seemed hopeless.</p>

    <p>Last week the mistress of the house where he was mostly
    employed sent him to the grocer's with, as usual, a slip of
    paper. The paper was addressed to the grocer, and it said,
    "Please do your utmost to give the bearer some sugar and tea.
    Even the smallest quantity will be gratefully welcomed."</p>

    <p>Entering the shop the soldier laid the message on the
    counter, prepared to wait patiently for the harassed tradesman
    to attend to him. He had often been there before and knew what
    it meant; but on this occasion the grocer instantly advanced to
    meet him, took the paper smilingly and read it.</p>

    <p>"Certainly," he replied. "I suppose four pounds of each
    would be enough to go on with?"</p>

    <p>"Four pounds!" said the soldier. "Strike me pink, she'd
    think herself the Queen with four ounces!"</p>

    <h2>THE HUT.</h2>

    <p>As ordered, we marched the Battery to B 35d 45.25. Reader,
    have you ever lived in, or on, an unfurnished map-reference in
    Flanders? If not, permit me to inform you that this group of
    letters and numerals represented a mud-flat pocked with ancient
    shell-craters, through which loafed an unwholesome stream under
    a bilious-looking sky. The Junior Subaltern, fresh from home,
    asked where the billets were. We could but bless his happy
    innocence and remind him that as Army Field Artillery we were
    nobody's children, the orphan bravoes of the Western Front, and
    that for us a bunch of map co-ordinates was considered ample
    provision.</p>

    <p>The horses, having with proper pride sneered at the stream,
    were silenced with their nosebags, and then we asked our cook
    what about it? That dauntless artist in bully-beef promptly
    brought our far-travelled mess-table into action in the open,
    and thus publicly we sat round it on our valises and drank
    Vichy water until the novelty palled. Then the rain began and
    the men once more united in wishing themselves in
    Tennessee.</p>

    <p>The Captain was now driven from the bosom of the mess to
    find a Camp Commandant, and to tell him, with the Major's
    compliments, that even the personnel of Army Brigades were
    liable, in the words of the book, to deteriorate rapidly if
    unprotected from damp. The officer, whom he found lurking in a
    neighbouring Nissen hut, was tall and stately, but admitted,
    under pressure, that to him was entrusted the stewardship of
    our mud-flat and the adjacent camps, and that he could give us
    a mess. Through the insistent drizzle this person, smiling now
    very pleasantly, led us to a depressed wooden building that
    suggested a derelict Noah's Ark with a sinister look about the
    windows. The bad-tempered sky scowled between the planks of the
    roof; the querulous wind whined up through the floor; rats
    backed snarling into the corners on our entrance.</p>

    <p>"This is the place," said the C.C. "You'll soon make
    yourselves very comfortable."</p>

    <p>That night I dreamed I was a "U" boat, and started up,
    snorting, to find myself under a cascade, while the felt upon
    the roof banged and rasped and flapped. It sounded as if the
    ark were trying to fly, but found its wings rusty. At dawn we
    sent the Captain out, and refused him breakfast till by some
    resource of ingenuity or crime he obtained certain sausages of
    new felt. These our fearless batmen unrolled and nailed upon
    the roof. After his porridge we pushed him out again with a
    strong party under orders to carry the nearest R.E. dump by
    force or fraud, and secure large quantities of timber, nails,
    canvas and, if possible (the up-to-date R.E. dump secretes many
    unexpected commodities), Turkey carpets, wall-paper,
    sofa-cushions and bedroom-slippers.</p>

    <p>The batmen were sent out with a limbered cart, some smoke
    shell and the total establishment of billhooks, and forbidden
    to return without sufficient material for bedsteads,
    window-shutters, bookshelves and chairs. By evening the place
    began to feel habitable, and the C.C., when he looked in to
    borrow a horse, endeared himself to us all by his obvious
    pleasure in our comparative comfort. We lent him the best horse
    in the battery.</p>

    <p>The Major's batman devoted the following day to the
    construction of a species of retiring-room at one end of the
    hut, wherein the modest members of the mess might bathe and
    splash at ease. The remainder of the servants went out armed
    and returned with (1) a zinc bath, (2) a stove, (3) a cuckoo
    clock, (4) a large mirror, (5) a warming-pan. "Once let us make
    a home for ourselves," we said, "and our energies will be free
    to finish the War." We devoted every cunning worker in the
    battery to this great end. Drill was abandoned, stables
    forgotten. We installed bookshelves, bootjacks, a sideboard,
    hat racks, a dumb waiter, a stand for the gramophone and a
    roll-top desk for the Major. The walls were tapestried with
    canvas, hung with pictures, scalps, and the various decorations
    won by members of the mess. The original building, disreputable
    and hateful, was hidden and forgotten.</p>

    <p>And then the C.C. called again, and, after a minute and
    admiring inspection of our abode, informed us that to his
    bitter sorrow he had to turn us out;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page387"
       id="page387"></a>[pg 387]</span> umteen battalions of
       infantry were coming in and had to be
       accommodated&mdash;this being an infantry camp....</p>

    <p>That night, as I walked about in the rain, I looked in at
    the open door of our lost home. Two N.C.O.'s were sitting over
    our stove, lost, lonely in the elongated emptiness; longing, I
    knew, to be with their comrades bellowing in an adjacent hut.
    And so I understood and knew at length how Camp Commandants
    manage the maintenance and improvement of their domain. I
    devote myself now to warning the simple-hearted gunner against
    unfurnished huts and the hospitality of Camp Commandants. And
    some day I hope to be in a position to lend that particular
    C.C. another horse.</p>

    <h2>TO HELP OUR OTHER ARMY.</h2>

    <p>With all eyes so focussed on the great deeds of our men in
    France, in Palestine and on the sea, there is a possibility of
    losing sight now and then of the constant and devoted efforts
    of the women and girls at home, without whose co-operation the
    War could not be successfully waged at all. We are the debtors
    not only of the munition workers who, in their hundreds of
    thousands, are toiling for victory, but of women and girls in
    myriad other employments, which they have cheerfully attacked
    and mastered; and any little thing that we can do for them
    should, Mr. Punch holds, be done. A practical and very simple
    way of adding to their happiness and well-being is to
    contribute a mite to the funds of the Girls' Friendly Society,
    an organisation with the finest traditions, which is doing its
    best to build rest and recreation huts all over England, for
    the purpose of conserving the health and spirits of our great
    feminine army. A moment's thought will show how vitally and
    nationally important such help is. Contributions should be sent
    to the Secretary, War Emergency Committee, Girls' Friendly
    Society, 39, Victoria Street, S.W.1.</p>

    <h2>MY AUNT MATILDA.</h2>

    <p>"It's too bad," said Francesca, "it really is. It'll spoil
    Christmas."</p>

    <p>"The question is," I said, "that this House do accept my
    Aunt Matilda's invitation of herself to stay in it for an
    uncertain period at or about Christmas. I think the Ayes have
    it."</p>

    <p>"The Noes have it," shouted Francesca.</p>

    <p>"Francesca," I said, "it's no use struggling, and you know
    it. We've got to have Aunt Matilda, and there's an end of
    it."</p>

    <p>"There isn't an end of it at all. It's only just beginning,
    and it'll go on getting worse and worse."</p>

    <p>"You do not seem to realise," I said, "what the possession
    of an aunt like Aunt Matilda means. She is like all the aunts
    you've ever read about in novels, only more so. She's so true
    to type that you can hardly believe in her existence. To be
    related to her is to have a Stake in the Country and to be part
    of the British Constitution, which she ardently believes in
    without knowing anything about it. She's been a widow for
    fifteen years, and&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Poor old thing," said Francesca, "so she has."</p>

    <p>"&mdash;for fifteen solitary years she has battled against
    the world, and managed her business affairs extraordinarily
    well; and yet she believes that women are perfect fools, and
    pities them from the bottom of her heart for being women."</p>

    <p>"As far as I'm concerned," said Francesca, "she may pity all
    the other women if she'll only not pity me. If I have a
    headache she not only pities me, but despises me as a weakling
    utterly unfitted to manage a household. No, my dear, I can't
    face it. Your Aunt Matilda's too much for me."</p>

    <p>"I admit," I said, "that she's a good deal."</p>

    <p>"And of course she'll bring her maid."</p>

    <p>"And her pug."</p>

    <p>"Whose name is 'MacLachlan,' and you mustn't call him 'Mac'
    because it's disrespectful."</p>

    <p>"And the children won't be allowed to shout about the house
    when she takes her nap. And of course they <i>will</i> shout
    about the house, and then there'll be trouble.".</p>

    <p>"And the children will be compared with other children who
    are much better behaved."</p>

    <p>"It's a queer thing, but the children don't seem to mind
    her."</p>

    <p>"She bribes them with chocolates."</p>

    <p>"Well, she won't do it any more, because there are no
    chocolates in the world. Chocolates are a luxury."</p>

    <p>"So's your aunt," said Francesca. "She's the biggest luxury
    I ever heard of. She's rare&mdash;I might almost say unique.
    She's expensive, and she can be done without. Obviously she's
    forbidden by the Defence of the Realm Act. We shall be fined
    and imprisoned if we conceal her here."</p>

    <p>"Well, you'd better sit down and tell her so, and get it off
    your chest."</p>

    <p>"I suppose I must play the humbug."</p>

    <p>"Yes, do. She'll see through you all right, though."</p>

    <p>"Oh, I say," said Francesca, "there's a P.S. to her letter.
    She says she's saved two pounds out of her sugar ration, and
    she's sending it to us as a Christmas present. Isn't she an old
    topper?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, "I forgive her everything. Is two pounds a
    lot?"</p>

    <p>"It's generally supposed to be just two pounds," said
    Francesca. R. C. L.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</h4>

    <p>At this date "The Junior Sub" fortunately needs no
    introduction to a public that has long gathered him and his to
    its appreciative heart. I should not like to guess how many
    people read and enjoyed <i>The First Hundred Thousand</i>; they
    all, and more, will delight in the appearance of <i>Carrying
    On</i> (BLACKWOOD), in which the exploits of the famous
    regiment, of <i>Major Wagstaffe</i> and <i>Captain Bobby
    Little</i> and the rest of them are continued. What the precise
    war position of IAN HAY may be by now I am unaware, but I
    should emphatically suggest his appointment to the post of
    Official Cheerer-Up. Perhaps (how shall I put it?) the
    eye-pieces of the writer's mask are a trifle too rose-coloured
    for strict realism; great-hearted gentlemen as we know our
    heroes to be, are they always quite so merry and bright as
    here? One can but hope so. In any case, as special propaganda
    on the part of the O.C.U., the stories could hardly be
    bettered. One, called "The Push that Failed," I would order to
    be read aloud to the workers in every munition factory in the
    land; its heartening tale of how the British people had, to the
    paralysed astonishment of Brother Bosch, "delivered the goods"
    to such effect that his projected spectacular attack under the
    eyes of WILLIAM the Worst was smashed before it began, is of a
    kind to strengthen the most weary arm. While I was yet upon the
    final page the bells in a famous abbey tower close by broke
    into grateful clamour for the news of victory. But IAN HAY does
    not wait on victory; he has his joy-bells ringing always in our
    hearts.</p>

    <p><i>The Tree of Heaven</i> (CASSELL) spread its friendly
    branches over a pleasant corner of a roomy Hampstead garden.
    Matter-of-fact <i>Anthony</i>, the timber merchant, always
    would insist that it was a mere common ash; but the others,
    <i>Frances</i>, and the children, <i>Dorothy, Michael,
    Nicky</i> and adopted <i>Veronica</i>, knew better, as also, no
    doubt, did <i>Jane-Pussy</i> and her little son, <i>Jerry</i>,
    who was <i>Nicky's</i> most especial pal. Miss MAY SINCLAIR,
    without being a conscienceless sentimentalist, does us the fine
    service of reminding us that the world of men is not all drab
    ugliness, but that there are beautiful human relationships and
    unselfish characters, and wholesome training which justifies
    itself in the day of trial. She divides her charming chronicle
    into three parts&mdash;Peace, The Vortex, and Victory. The
    first deals with the childhood of the happy brood of
    <i>Anthony</i> and <i>Frances</i>, delicate studies subtly
    differentiated. Even the little cats have their astonishing
    individuality, and I don't envy anyone who can read of
    <i>Jerry's</i> death and <i>Nicky's</i> grief without a gulp.
    The Vortex is&mdash;no, not the War; that comes later&mdash;but
    the trials of a world which tests adolescence, a world of
    suffrage rebellions, of Futuristic art and morals. Then the
    real vortex of the War, the Victory which means ready (or
    difficult, unready) sacrifice and death for the boys and their
    friends and as great a sacrifice and as cruel a thing as death
    for the others, the women and the elders.... A novel, which is
    much more than a novel, packed with beauty and sincerity,
    setting forth its tragedy without false glamour or shallow
    consolations.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Since it is natural to expect that a much-heralded book will
    fail, when it does eventually appear, to fulfil the promise of
    its publishers, it is the more pleasant to find oneself
    agreeing with Messrs. HODDER AND STOUGHTON that bashfulness on
    their part would have been out of place in regard to Mr. JAMES
    W. GERARD'S memoirs, <i>My Four Years in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page390"
       id="page390"></a>[pg 390]</span> Germany</i>. As read in
       their completed and collected form these papers are not
       only, as one could foresee, of historic importance, but they
       are moreover capital reading. There is a world of unaffected
       geniality and humour about them that forms a most admirable
       complement to such serious matters as the protracted
       negotiations over the U-boat campaign, or the now famous
       incriminating telegram addressed by the ALL-HIGHEST to
       President WILSON in the days before the Huns had quite
       decided with what lies to defend the indefensible. This
       document is reproduced in facsimile as the egregious sender
       of telegrams wrote it for Mr. GERARD to transmit, and is one
       link more in the thrice-forged chain of evidence. But even
       stronger witness to German guilt is to be found in the
       series of minor corroborations appearing incidentally in the
       course of Mr. GERARD'S narrative, whether the author is
       pretending to be in awe of Prussian Court Etiquette, or
       openly laughing at the Orders of the Many Coloured Eagles,
       or simply detailing his work at Ruhleben and the other
       prison camps. His devotion there has earned a gratitude
       throughout this country that it would be mere presumption to
       try to put into words.</p>

    <p>Those of us who have loitered with Mr. DE VERE STACPOOLE by
    blue lagoons and silent pools know that he is a master of
    atmosphere, and so he proves himself again in <i>The Starlit
    Garden</i> (HUTCHINSON), though it takes him some time to get
    there. When a young American finds himself the guardian of an
    Irish flapper&mdash;a distant relation&mdash;and comes over to
    take her back with him to the States, it does not require much
    perspicacity to guess what will happen. <i>Phyl Berknowles</i>
    strongly objects to the intrusion of <i>Richard Pinckney</i>
    into the glorious muddle of her Irish m&eacute;nage, and
    irritates him so successfully that he returns in a considerable
    tantrum to America, leaving her with some friends in Dublin. So
    far the tale is lively enough, but not until <i>Phyl</i> feels
    the call of her blood and goes to stay with her relatives in
    Charleston does the author find scope for his peculiar charm.
    Then we get a most delightful picture of a starlit garden in
    the south of America, where <i>Phyl's</i> experiences, without
    placing a tiresome strain upon our powers of belief, produce a
    sensation at once romantic and unusual. Memories of the past
    hang over this garden, and although Mr. STACPOOLE'S attempt to
    reconcile the period of which he writes with the years that are
    gone is not uniformly successful I am cordially glad that he
    made it.</p>

    <p>The publishers of Mrs. ALICE PERRIN'S new volume, <i>Tales
    that are Told</i> (SKEFFINGTON), appear to be anxious that the
    public should have no hesitations on the score of measure
    supplied, as they explain that the chief of the tales is "a
    short novel of over 20,000 words." I am content to take their
    word for the figure, but I agree that they were well advised to
    focus attention upon "Gift of God," which, whatever its length,
    is an admirable and distinguished piece of writing. The subject
    of it is the old question of mixed-marriage, but treated from a
    new aspect. <i>Kudah Bux</i> (the Gift in question) is the son
    of an adoring Mohamedan father; he goes to England for
    education in the law, and there falls in love with and marries
    the brainless daughter of a London landlady. He is a very human
    and appealing figure. The debacle that follows his return to
    India with so impossible a bride is told in a way that
    convinces. Here Mrs. PERRIN is at her best. Some of the shorter
    tales also succeed very happily in conveying that peculiar
    Simla-by-South-Kensington atmosphere of retired Anglo-Indian
    society which she suggests with such intimate understanding.
    But, to be honest, the others (with the exception of one quaint
    little comedy of a canine ghost) are but indifferent stuff, too
    full of snakes and hidden treasure and general
    tawdriness&mdash;the kind of Orientalism, in fact, that one
    used to associate chiefly with the Earl's Court Exhibition.
    Mrs. PERRIN must not mingle her genuine native goods with such
    Brummagem ware.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>My idea is that when Mr. H.C. BAILEY called his latest story
    <i>The Young Lovers</i> (METHUEN) he was doing it something
    less than justice. For the width and variety of the plot make
    it far more than a mere love-tale. <i>Arma virique</i> are
    quite as much Mr. BAILEY'S theme as Cupid, who indeed makes a
    rather belated appearance at the tag end. Before that we have a
    vast deal of agreeable adventuring. The scene is set in the
    period of the Peninsular War; all the characters, lovers,
    parents and hangers-on, are more or less involved in the
    fluctuating fortunes of my Lord WELLINGTON. There are spies of
    both sides, intrigues, abductions and what not. Mr. BAILEY has
    a pretty touch for such matters; his people move with an air;
    and, if at times their speech seems a trifle over-burnished,
    dulness is far from them. Moreover, the incidents of the
    campaign give scope for some vivid descriptions of war and
    battles, as such were in the old days before Mars put off his
    gold lace and sacrificed the picturesque. Sometimes, on the
    other hand, it is the similarity of conditions then and now
    that will strike you. For example, the passage telling how,
    despite apparent inactivity and home prognostications of
    stalemate, the confidence of the Army grew from day to
    day&mdash;impossible not to see the very obvious parallel
    there. In fine, Mr. BAILEY has given us another brisk and
    engaging romance, which, if it is not quite the kind you might
    expect from its title, is something a good deal better worth
    reading.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
